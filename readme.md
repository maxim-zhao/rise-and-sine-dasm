Rise and Sine disassembly
=========================

[Rise and Sine](https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=96109) was a 255 byte size-coding competition entry by Darklite, coded by Neon, released at Lovebyte 2024.

This is a disassembly of it that I made in order to understand how it works. The code remains copyrighted by the original authors until they choose to release it, but the comments are all mine.

1. Sine table generation: 26 bytes code
2. Art loading: 36 bytes code + 8 bytes data
3. Palette loading: 6 bytes code + 18 bytes data
4. System setup: 6 bytes code + 10 bytes data
5. Main loop: 143 bytes (more breakdown to come)
